## Motivation

This project was developed as a proof-of-concept for the Aggie Robotics' Sumobots program. The program sought to provide an accessible, self-paced, engineering project that members of the club could tackle as their time allowed. The design goals sought to minimize cost and software complexity. 

For more information about Sumobots, please see the AggieRobotics website (link coming soon)
