# Examples

This folder contains a series of minimum functional code examples that should allow for a quick start to development. While it is likely possible to start at the final one and understand the code, it may be easier to progress through them in order. The intended order is `Fundamentals` > `Skeleton Code` > `With Motors` > `Joystick Drive`

Sample 3d Models are collected on the [CADExamples](CADExamples.md) page.

# Contributing

## Independent Work

If you create your own code/interface/UI/etc and want to share it, please open a pull request providing it/ a link to your repo.

## Future Work

These are some areas that we believe are logical 'next steps' of the development process. If you want to tackle one of these, please do and open a pull request:

* Register the server as a linux service
* Proper HTML/CSS/Javascript joystick (2 axis) template
    * Will likely require use of JavaScript's `touchpoint` library
* Fancy JS (such as React)
* Collecting inputs via a controller on phone and/or laptop
* Prettier interfaces
